#RL Lab3

Running lab3.py will run all experiments and create a .pkl file similar to results-for-figs.pkl. Any difference are due to the stochastic nature of the results.

Running lab3-plot-results.py will then plot four figures; our three main results, and the extra result in the appendix of the blog post.
