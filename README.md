#RL Lab3

Install the required environment by typing the following commands in your terminal (ensure you have `conda` installed)

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate rl2019
```
Then, running `lab3.py` will run all experiments and create a `.pkl` file similar to `results-for-figs.pkl`. Any difference are due to the stochastic nature of the results.

Running `lab3-plot-results.py` will then plot four figures; our three main results, and the first result of the appendix of the blog post. The data is also available for plotting the second graph in our results section.
